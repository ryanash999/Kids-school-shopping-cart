# Kids-school-shopping-cart

Helped demonstrate the power of scripting for my 6th grader son.  His assignment was to use a minimum of 10 products across different categories.  Each category had a preassigned discount level and tax should also be assumed.  The goal was to get as close to $500 without going over.  

This script could be made much more efficient to demonstrate better learning possibilities.  

Simply download and run the script, assuming you have Perl installed and the necessary plugins.  

Example output:

```
total: 500
SUCCESS: total = 500
Calculations done: 23132

	tv (Electronis): 159.99 x 1 (156.95)
